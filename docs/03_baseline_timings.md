## Scan Type and Why Each Query is Slow or Fast

| Query | Scan Type | Why slow / fast |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| R01 | Seq Scan on trips | No index on `(rider_id, requested_at)`. Scans all 300,000 trips to find 20 for one rider. |
| R02 | Seq Scan on trips | No index on `(driver_id, status, requested_at)`. Full scan to filter one driver's March trips. |
| R03 | Seq Scan on riders | `LOWER(email) = ?` cannot use the UNIQUE index on `email` (different expression). Full scan of 30,000 riders. |
| R04 | Seq Scan on trips, cities | No index on `(city_id, requested_at)`. Full scan of trips then filter by date range. |
| R05 | Seq Scan on trips | No partial index on active statuses (REQUESTED/ACCEPTED/ONGOING = only 300 rows out of 300,000). Full scan. |
| R06 | Seq Scan on trips, cities | Same as R04 — no index on `(city_id, status, requested_at)`. |
| R07 | Seq Scan on trips, drivers, cities | No composite index. Three-table join, all sequential. |
| R08 | Seq Scan on payments | No index on `(payment_status, paid_at)`. Scans all 245,839 payments. |
| R09 | Seq Scan on riders, trips | `NOT IN (subquery)` with no index on `requested_at`. Subquery scans all trips; outer scans all riders. |
| R10 | Seq Scan on drivers, trips | Same pattern as R09 with `NOT IN`. |
| R11 | Seq Scan on trips, ratings | No index on `(rated_by, trip_id)` in ratings. Scans 307,214 ratings and 300,000 trips. |
| R12 | Seq Scan on trips, cities | No index on `(city_id, requested_at)`. Scans all trips to find Delhi ones and extract hour. |
| R13 | Seq Scan on riders | `ILIKE '%sharma%'` cannot use a B-tree index (leading wildcard). Scans all 30,000 riders. |
| R14 | **Index Scan** (vehicles UNIQUE, drivers PK) | UNIQUE index on `registration_no` already exists. Tiny: 0.033 ms. This is what fast looks like. |
| R15 | Index Scan (trips/riders/drivers/vehicles PK), Seq Scan payments | PK lookups are fast. Payments has no index on `trip_id` — sequential scan but only 245k rows so still fast. |
| R16 | Index Scan (trips PK) | PK index used to ORDER BY trip_id DESC, but `OFFSET 200000` forces reading and discarding 200,000 rows. Slow at high page numbers. |
| R17 | Seq Scan on trips, cities | No index; full scan to compute cancellation counts for all cities. |
| R18 | **Seq Scan on trips (correlated subquery)** | **WORST QUERY: 20 seconds.** For every Pune rider (~3,000), the correlated subquery `SELECT max(requested_at) FROM trips WHERE rider_id = ?` runs a full 300,000-row scan. That's 3,000 × 300,000 = 900 million row checks. |
| R19 | Seq Scan on trips, drivers | No index on `(driver_id, status, requested_at)`. Full scans for window function. |
| R20 | Seq Scan on trips | No index on `(status, requested_at)`. Scans trips to group May 2026 revenue by day. |
| R21 | Seq Scan on trips, promo_codes | No index on `trips.promo_code`. Full scan to count promo usage. |
| R22 | Seq Scan on payments, Index Scan on trips/riders | Payments scanned fully despite date filter because no index on `(payment_status, paid_at)`. |
| R23 | Seq Scan on trips | No index on `(city_id, requested_at)`. Scans all trips for 2026 distinct-rider count. |
| R24 | Seq Scan on trips | No index on `distance_km` or `duration_min`. Full scan to find outlier trips. |
| R25 | Seq Scan on trips | No index for `fare_amount / distance_km > 100` expression. Full scan. |
| W01 | (no scan — INSERT) | Direct INSERT by PK. Fast: 0.645 ms. |
| W02 | Index Scan (trips PK) | `WHERE trip_id = (SELECT min(...))` — uses PK, fast lookup. But the subquery `SELECT min(trip_id) WHERE status='ONGOING'` does a seq scan. |
| W03 | Seq Scan on drivers | Full scan of 3,000 drivers to find active ones rated below 3.5. Small table, fast enough. |
| W04 | (no scan — INSERT … SELECT generate_series) | Bulk insert of 5,000 rows via function, no table scan. |
| W05 | **Seq Scan on trips** | **SECOND SLOWEST: 19 seconds.** `DELETE … WHERE status LIKE 'CANCELLED%' AND requested_at < '2025-02-01'` scans all 300,000 trips. No index on `(status, requested_at)`. On large data this will be catastrophic. |

## Key Observations

1. **R18 (20.5 s) is the catastrophic query.** Correlated subquery runs once per rider — O(riders × trips). Will scale to 3 minutes on 20× data.

2. **W05 (19 s) is the second worst.** Full table scan DELETE. On 6M trips it becomes a 6-minute operation.

3. **Almost everything does a Seq Scan on trips.** The 300,000-row trips table is scanned fresh for every single query because there are zero non-PK indexes. This is the #1 fix for Phase 4.

4. **R14 is already fast (0.033 ms)** because the UNIQUE constraint on `registration_no` auto-created an index. This shows exactly what well-placed indexes can do.

5. **R10 contains a critical wrong-result bug** — the `NOT IN (subquery)` pattern evaluates to `UNKNOWN` whenever any `driver_id` in the subquery is NULL (from cancelled trips without an assigned driver), causing the entire query to return 0 rows instead of 978. R09 also uses `NOT IN` and will be rewritten to `NOT EXISTS` in Phase 4.
