## What This Project Does

Uber India runs a ride-hailing service across 10 cities. The database was built quickly with no documented schema — only raw CSV data exports. Our job across 5 phases:

1. **Understand** the 9 performance problems reported by product teams
2. **Build** a correct, well-constrained schema from CSV data exports
3. **Measure** how 30 key queries perform (baseline timings)
4. **Optimize** them using indexes + query rewrites (results must stay identical)
5. **Prove** the database can handle 20× growth (partitioning + scalability design)

## How to Run Everything From Scratch

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 15+ installed and running
- `seed_data.zip` unzipped to `seed_data/` in project root
- `psql` CLI available

### Step 1: Create database and schema
```bash
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE uber_db;"
psql -d uber_db -f sql/01_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Load seed data
```bash
psql -d uber_db -f sql/02_load_data.sql
```
This loads 8 CSV files in FK-safe order and runs 5 integrity checks.

### Step 3: Run baseline benchmarks (Phase 3)
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh uber_db baseline 3
```
Output: `benchmarks/results/baseline/summary.csv` + raw plans for all 30 queries.

### Step 4: Apply indexes (Phase 4)
```bash
psql -d uber_db -f sql/05_indexes.sql
```
Creates 18 secondary indexes (composite, partial, expression, GIN trigram).

### Step 5: Run optimized benchmarks (Phase 4)
```bash
./benchmarks/run_benchmark.sh uber_db optimized 3 sql/06_optimized_queries.sql
```
Output: `benchmarks/results/optimized/summary.csv` + raw plans.

### Step 6: Set up partitioning (Phase 5)
```bash
psql -d uber_db -f sql/08_partitioning.sql
```
Creates monthly RANGE partitions on trips, verifies partition pruning with EXPLAIN.

## Phase-by-Phase Summary

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding + Schema Design

**9 problems identified** (P1-P9), classified as customer-facing/real-time or reporting/analytics:
- P1: Rider trip history slow (R01, R15)
- P2: Driver earnings slow (R02, R07, R19)
- P3: Email login fails with capitals (R03)
- P4: Live dispatch refresh > 3s (R04, R05, W01, W02)
- P5: Finance reports timeout (R08, R20, R22)
- P6: Win-back campaign wrong results (R09, R10, R18)
- P7: Fraud checks scan whole table (R24, R25)
- P8: Admin pagination degrades (R16)
- P9: Analytics dashboards slow (R06, R11, R12, R17, R21, R23)

**Schema:** 8 tables in `uber` schema, 13+ CHECK constraints, composite PK on ratings `(trip_id, rated_by)`, nullable driver_id/vehicle_id for cancelled trips, justified denormalized rating columns.

### Phase 2: Baseline Timings

All 30 queries benchmarked with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, 3 runs each. Key findings:
- Almost every query does **Seq Scan on trips** (300k rows) — no non-PK indexes existed
- R18 (20.5s) and W05 (19.1s) are catastrophically slow
- R14 (0.033ms) is already fast — UNIQUE index on registration_no existed
- R10's `NOT IN` returns 0 rows — the **wrong-result bug**

### Phase 3: Optimization

**18 secondary indexes created** across 5 types:

| Type | Example | Serves |
|------|---------|--------|
| Composite B-tree | `(rider_id, requested_at DESC)` | R01 |
| Partial | `WHERE status IN ('REQUESTED','ACCEPTED','ONGOING')` | R05, W02, W05 |
| Expression | `ON riders (LOWER(email))` | R03 |
| GIN trigram | `USING GIN (full_name gin_trgm_ops)` | R13 |
| FK index | `ON payments (trip_id)` | R15 |

**7 queries rewritten:**
- R02, R08, R20: `DATE()` / `EXTRACT()` / `::date` → sargable TIMESTAMPTZ ranges
- R09, R10: `NOT IN` → `NOT EXISTS` (R10 fixes the nullable-driver NULL bug; R09 uses the null-safe anti-join pattern)
- R16: `OFFSET 200000` → keyset pagination `WHERE trip_id <= anchor`
- R18: correlated subquery → `LEFT JOIN ... GROUP BY` (802× faster)

**Bug fixed:** R10 `NOT IN (subquery)` returned 0 rows because cancelled trips have NULL `driver_id`. When a subquery returns NULL, `NOT IN` evaluates to UNKNOWN for every row. Fixed with `NOT EXISTS` → returns correct 978 rows.

### Phase 4: Scalability

**Partitioning:** `trips` table partitioned by RANGE on `requested_at` (monthly). A query for May 2026 only scans `trips_2026_05` (~16k rows) instead of all 300k — 94% data eliminated. Verified with EXPLAIN.

**Growth analysis (3 categories):**
- Stayed same (<3×): 15 queries using index seeks or partition pruning
- Grew ~20× (linear): 7 queries that must read most of the table (honest scans)
- Would have grown >20× without fix: R18 (quadratic → linear), W05 (full scan → partial index)

**Architecture for 100× scale:**
- Partitioning: RANGE monthly on `requested_at` (done)
- Sharding: by `city_id` (trips are city-local)
- Read replicas: analytics queries → replica; writes + real-time → primary
- VACUUM: aggressive autovacuum for trips (scale_factor = 0.01)
- Caching: Redis for login (R03), promo usage (R21), surge (R12)

## Topics Covered

- Data types & constraints (NUMERIC for money, TIMESTAMPTZ, CHAR(10) for phone)
- Keys & relationships (composite PK on ratings, FK with CASCADE/RESTRICT/SET NULL)
- Normalization (3NF/BCNF analysis with functional dependencies)
- Query execution plans (EXPLAIN ANALYZE, Seq Scan vs Index Scan)
- Indexing (B-tree, partial, expression, GIN trigram, covering)
- Query optimization (sargable predicates, NOT EXISTS, keyset pagination, JOIN rewrite)
- VACUUM/ANALYZE (autovacuum settings for hot tables)
- Partitioning (RANGE by month, partition pruning, PK rules)
- Sharding (by city_id, cross-shard query handling)
- Read replicas and caching strategy
