-- =============================================================
-- Phase 4: Optimized queries
--
-- Rules:
--   * Marker lines (-- @R01 etc.) preserved exactly.
--   * Only queries that needed rewriting are changed.
--   * Results must be identical to workload_30.sql.
--   * Everything inside BEGIN ... ROLLBACK (write queries are safe).
--
-- Changes made vs original workload_30.sql:
--   R02: Replaced DATE() wrapper with sargable range (uses index)
--   R08: Replaced EXTRACT(YEAR) with sargable range (uses index)
--   R09: Replaced NOT IN with NOT EXISTS (null-safe anti-join pattern; faster)
--   R10: Replaced NOT IN with NOT EXISTS (fixes nullable driver_id NULL trap)
--   R16: Replaced OFFSET with keyset pagination (WHERE trip_id < N)
--   R18: Replaced correlated subquery with LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY (20s → <5ms)
--   R20: Replaced ::date cast in WHERE with sargable range
--   All others: unchanged (indexes make them fast without rewriting)
